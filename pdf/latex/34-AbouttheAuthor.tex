Michael David Warren built a career the industry said was impossible.

He never swept a salon floor. Never climbed the traditional ladder. Never waited for permission. Instead, he went straight to the arena---assisting hair legends Guido Palau, Jimmy Paul, and Jawara, learning under pressure, proving that an unconventional path could lead somewhere extraordinary.

That path took him to London, where he became Rihanna\textquotesingle s day-to-day hairstylist, and into the world of high-stakes creativity: keying Nike\textquotesingle s "Greatest Dynasty Ever" campaign, styling major red carpets at the SAG Awards and BET Awards, contributing editorial work to Harper\textquotesingle s Bazaar, W Magazine, Wonderland, and Coveteur, and shaping runway collections for Sergio Hudson.

Over more than twelve years, Michael\textquotesingle s work has carried him across Tokyo, Stockholm, Mexico City, and Paris---building a global career that doesn\textquotesingle t depend on one chair, one city, or one system.

But the work that changed him most didn\textquotesingle t happen on a set.

During lockdown, a client called in tears. Depression had swallowed her whole. Her hair was matted, tangled beyond what she could manage alone. She couldn\textquotesingle t face her own reflection. Michael sat with her at her kitchen table for hours, gently working through every knot while she cried. When he finished, she reached toward the mirror and whispered five words he will never forget:

"I forgot she was still in there."

That night, Michael started writing. Because he realized no amount of technical mastery prepares you for the moment when your craft becomes someone\textquotesingle s lifeline. And no stylist should ever be caught without the tools---business, wellness, boundaries, presence---to sustain both their clients and themselves.

\emph{Curls \& Contemplation} is the book Michael needed when he was couch-surfing and terrified, when the voice in his head whispered \emph{who do you think you are?} and the only answer was to keep going anyway.

It\textquotesingle s for the freelancer suffocating under the industry\textquotesingle s single blueprint. For the artist who knows that technique alone won\textquotesingle t save them. For the stylist at 2am, exhausted and searching, who needs someone to finally say: Your work matters more than you know. Every time you help someone see themselves again, you\textquotesingle re doing sacred work.

This isn\textquotesingle t a quick-fix manual or surface-level tips. It\textquotesingle s an interactive journey---real tools, real reflection, real strategy---for building a career that honors both the craft and the person holding the shears.

Michael is based in London. He still gets nervous before every big job. He recharges in solitude after the intensity of a set. And every single day, without fail, he calls his mum---because she\textquotesingle s one of the people who kept him grounded when everything was uncertain. He credits his grandmother as the first person who named his gift, believing his hands could make something beautiful long before the world did.

This book is his way of believing in yours.
